# Welcome to geomodelr's query tool

Geomodelr is a web tool for creating geological models easily.
To create a geological model, go to https://www.geomodelr.com.
After creating your geological model you might want to use it
for calculations, geostatistics, simulations, or simply to know
what geological unit is present at a given path. With this tool 
you can do all that.

To use geomodelr query tool you just need to:
```
import geomodelr
# load your model.
model = geomodelr.model_from_file('/path/to/your/model_version.json')
# query your model.
unit, distance = model.closest((1000, 1000, 0.0))
# do stuff...
if unit == 'Batholith':
...
```
You can also use this tool as a script.
```
$ geomodelr -q /path/to/your/model_version.json
x y z
Batholith
```

## Features
- Query the model in the coordinate system you defined.
- Query the topography heights and query the model with topography in mind.
- Query the intersection of faults and planes.
- Generate grids, use it as a help tool to generate meshes, assign properties for simulations or create block models.
- What do you want to do?

## Installation
Install project by calling:

    pip install geomodelr

It needs boost libraries and C++ compiler. In case boost libraries are not in a 
standard location, call it with `INCLUDE_DIRS=...` and/or `LIBRARY_DIRS=...`
